            <h5>Environment/Context</h5> 
            <p>
              The Brussels Management Challenge (which I will mention as BMC for simplicity) is an event where participants have to solve business-related cases.
              To participate you must form a team of 5 members consisting of 2 STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematic) students, 2 Management students and 1 that can be from any field.
            </br>It's a 2 to 3 days challenge that has exceptionnaly taken place at home due to sanitary restrictions (covid-19).
            </br>It was originally a student project that grew to become what it is today, that is to say an event bringing together several teams from different schools and even of different nationalities.
            That's why we had to speak English throughout the challenge whether it was between us or with the BMC crew. 
            </p>  
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              The whole challenge being in english, it goes without saying that I had the opportunity to train my english a little even if it was not the main purpose of the challenge.
              I also had the opportunity to meet the 2 management students who joined our team. 
            </br>It was very interesting to approach some cases with their vision noticeably different from the more cartesian vision that computer science students possesses.
            </br>Apart from that, I learned to analyze business type problems and try to develop solutions involving new technologies.
            </br>Having to take up the challenge completely in English, trying to find solutions with a team of people who don't know each other well, all in a relatively short time, taught me the importance of being able to communicate effectively within a team. 
              As well as working under pressure with little information and only my imagination as a compass. 
              No doubt it will be useful in my professional and private life later.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              I'm really happy that I made the decision to participate in this event as it taught me a lot, including how to tackle issues that can change drastically depending on our student background. 
              But also because it allowed me to question my creative side by having to look for ideas for each different case.
