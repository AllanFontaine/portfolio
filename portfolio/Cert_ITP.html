            <h5>Environment/Context</h5> 
            <p>
              As part of my studies at EPHEC, I had to do an internship in an IT company.
              Wanting to work in the field of network / cybersecurity, I turned to the ITP company, specializing in the implementation of networks and telephony systems.  
              I discovered this company in Ephec's suggestions for finding an internship location.
            </br>I was originally more interested in the network aspect than the VoIP aspect but over the course of my weeks of internship, I was able to learn a lot about the needs of companies in telephony.
            </br>I've realised this internship with my partner : <a href="https://gillestimothy.000webhostapp.com">Timothy Gilles</a>
            </p> 
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              I learned a lot of things while working as an intern for ITP.
            </br>Whether it was in relation to the tools used in companies (cable tracer, IP scanner, firewall, etc.) or the way of proceeding when establishing a contract with a new customer (analysis of needs and possible solutions , adaptation to an already existing situation, on-site visit of the infrastructure and location, implementation of the solution, etc.).
            </br>In addition to all this, I had the opportunity to learn more about telephony, the needs of the market but also the importance of securing communications via VoIP.
            </br>I also learned to use a 3D printing machine in my free time, so I was able to familiarize myself with the CURA software and the printing methods. I made several mistakes at the beginning that made me realize what to watch out for when printing.
            </br>And finally, I also learned a lot about the Avaya suite that ITP works with. Including how to configure an IPO (telephone exchange) in a fairly basic way, configure H323 SIP telephones from different brands, how dect telephones work and how to configure their antennas and much more.
              Everything I learned here will be useful to me later if I have to set up a telephone system for a company or mine but also because I have learned of the existence of a sector in cybersecurity dedicated to SIP telephony. .
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              I am happy to have chosen ITP for my internship. Not only because I had the opportunity to work in a close-knit and cool team, but also because I learned a lot about subjects that at first glance didn't seem particularly interesting to me.
