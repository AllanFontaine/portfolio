              <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-left quote-icon-left"></i><em> In belgium, just like in the rest of the world, cyber security has become a strategic priority for organizations across all sectors. 
                In this context, training and hiring young potential in the area of information security has become even more crucial than in the past. <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></em></i>

              The CSCB (I'll call it like that for the simplicity) is a challenge organized and sponsorized by several companies with the objective to discover and maybe hire young talent in cybersecurity.
              To participate, you need to register in a team of maximum 4 members. 
              The CSCB is a capture the flag challenge, meaning you've to retrieve a maximum of flag (sort of tag hidden in a file, in a code, in a server, ...) to win.
              The CSCB is divided in two phases :
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The first one is the qualifiers. It's open for every team and it consist in two days of capture the flag with all kind of challenges going from easy to complex. 
                  It's purpose is to determine the top 60 teams that will be invited to the second round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The second one is the final. The selected teams of the qualifiers face each other into a 2 days trial with more complex challenges.
                  At the conclusion of the event an award ceremony is held and the best-perfoming teams receive prizes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              At the beginning I was interested in participating to the CSCB because I wanted to add one more activity for my portfolio but also because I was curious to get a glimpse of what it was all about.
              But when the qualifiers started, I've quickly been absorbed by the challenges. I've discover a passion for this field that convince me into taking part to the CSCB again the year after and into making it my full-time job in the futur.
              Besides that growing passion, since cybersecurity touch many fields of IT going from network to developement to stegonography, I've been able to learn a lot of informations about what were the principal concerns about those IT fields regarding security.
              I also had the opportunity to work with various tools (photoshop, audacity, visual studio code, online cypher engine, ...) to solve the challenges.
              </br>I've been introduce to many subject of IT regarding security that will certainly serve me in the futur since I want to work in cybersecurity.  
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              Even if I couldn't make it to the top 60 two years in a row, I'm happy to have taken part in this challenge.
              </br>It was truly an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone with a minimum of curiosity about security in IT.
