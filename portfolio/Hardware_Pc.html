            <h5>Environment/Context</h5>
            <p>
              After the multiple problems that arose during the exams in June 2020 with my computers (crash and loss of data), I decided to redo a computer from A to Z, starting from almost no knowledge in the choice of my components.
              So I started to do my research on the different components on how to choose them, what criteria to look at, what were the recommendations, ....
              I've done the majority of my configuration with the configomatic from topachat which is a wonderfull tool!
            </br> After several tens of hours (summarized here in 15 hours + 5 hours of assembly), I resolved to order the different parts for which I had spent a lot of time saving.  
              Once the parts arrived, I started building my computer, looking at assembly tutorials first to make sure I was not going to make a mistake.
            </br>After successfuly building my first computer from scratch, one of my friend came to me to build one for him (on October).
              Being more comfortable in the choice of the component, the real difficulty here was to manage to match his budget and his needs.
              But I think I did pretty well since he seemed happy with his computer.
            </p>   
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              Saying that I learned a lot from a lot of different topics might sound like an easy shortcut but it is indeed the case, I've learned a lot!
            </br>Going into details would be too long so here is a list of things I've learned :
            <ul>
              <li><strong>RAM :</strong> Cas Latency, why a high bandwith is better, what more gb means, faster ram is better but if it's compatible with processor and motherboard otherwise it's useless, ...</li>
              <li><strong>Motherboard :</strong> Exist in different format (EATX, ATX, mini ATX, micro ATX, ...), sometimes the price is higher for no real reason, northbridge and southbridge, there is different cpu socket, ....</li>
              <li><strong>CPU : </strong> Some applications benefit from a faster gpu will some benefit from more core, the different size of impression, the architectures, ...</li>
              <li><strong>GPU : </strong> The different form of technologies used (AI, Ray-tracing, ...), ray-tracing processor unit, what is essentially a gpu (kind of a mini computer by itself), ...</li>
              <li><strong>PSU : </strong> How to choose the correct power, why too much isn't always better (performance range), meaning of the 80+ certifications, ...</li>
              <li><strong>Storage :</strong> All about ssd/nvme m2 ssd/hdd differences, the read/write speed, cycle of life of ssd, caching, ...</li>
              <li><strong>Case :</strong> Push/Pull or in balanced airflow pro's and con's, why RGB is mandatory to increase performance (it's totaly not but it kinda feel like it :p ), ...</li>
            </ul>
              I think what I have learned so far will come in handy in my future life whether I have to make the choice of components for a business or for myself. 
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              I'm still learning a lot and refining my skills and my ability to choose the right thing for the right budget.
              I discovered a passion for this field and continue to learn more about it every day.
