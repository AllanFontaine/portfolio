            <h5>Environment/Context</h5> 
            <p>
              As part of my internship at ITP, I had to configure phones or Avaya systems (telephone exchange) for customers. 
              The boss then suggested that I register for the Avaya online courses in order to train myself if I wanted to and thus have certifications to promote on the market. 
              There was no obligations but the choice was given to me to do it and I've done it.  
            </p>            
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              The courses I learned were mainly based on the different solutions offered by avaya for medium-sized companies with only a maximum of 3000 endpoints.
              These courses also explained to us the needs in IP telephony for companies and to what extent a suitable telephone solution could be a huge boost for companies wishing to broaden their fields of expertise.
              We also learned the methods to determine the client's needs in terms of IP telephony in order to be able to offer him a solution that fits with his business plan and budget.
              I think knowing your client and his needs is fundamental in order to be able to provide the right services and ensure that the client stays loyal. 
            </br>It goes without saying that I would apply this method throughout my career.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              Despite the fact that the courses were more focused on a salesperson approach than a Technician approach, I enjoyed learning more about the IP telephony market. This allowed me to understand its importance.
