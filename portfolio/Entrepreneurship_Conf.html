            <h5>Environment/Context</h5> 
            <p>
              I had the opportunity to participate in several conferences / workshops on the theme of entrepreneurship during my first 2 years of studies (the last being always remote) whether these events were organized by EPHEC or another establishement.
              I will focus here on one of the workshops organized by the EPHEC and explain what others have given me in a more general way.
              </br>This particular event (How I meet my Cofounder), organized by the EPHEC in partnership with Yncubator, aimed to bring together several potential future entrepreneurs so that they had the opportunity to share their ideas and maybe find in another one a potential cofounder.  
            </p>  
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              First of all, let's talk about the Himmc (hom I met my cofounder). 
              As previously said, the purpose of this workshop was to meet other potential futur entrepreneurs, confront our ideas with them and discuss about a possible partnership.
            </br>Participating in this kind of event allowed me to confront my business idea with an audience of diverse backgrounds in order to see if it had a potential audience.
              I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was not the only one to see potential in my idea and to see that a market was potentially waiting to be conquered.
            </br>It also allowed me to analyze the ideas of others to detect small weaknesses or even quite simply to discover people with super interesting ideas.
              That workshop has given me new ideas to strengthen my personal project.
            </br>Regarding the other conferences / workshops, these mainly allowed me to learn more about entrepreneurship in general, entrepreneurial spirit,entrepreneurship legislation, student-entrepreneur status, ...
              No doubt it will help me later if I decide to get into entrepreneurship!
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              I regret not having been able to participate in more workshops of this kind during my studies at Ephec because of covid-19.
              But I am happy to have been part of such incredible experiences and if I had to do it again, I would do it without hesitation.
