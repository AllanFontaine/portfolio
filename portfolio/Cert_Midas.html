            <h5>Environment/Context</h5>
            <p>
              As part of my evening classes at EFP, I had to take part in an internship in a garage to complete my training and validate my learning. 
              I had to do 500 hours over my 3 years of training in a garage of my choice.
            </br>The first year, I couldn't find a garage that wanted to take an unpaid intern because my hours were not fixed due to the fact that I had lessons at EPHEC during all the week.
            </br>In the second year, I managed to find the Midas garage as a garage to take me on as an intern thanks to my aunt who knew the manager.
              I then continued to do my last hours this year 2021 to complete my internship.
            </p>   
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              I learned many things working as an intern at midas, the garage being a multi-brand, I was confronted with all kinds of mechanical or electronic breakdowns but also with maintenance of vehicles ranging from vans to sports cars. 
              I had the opportunity to do:
              <ul>
                <li>Maintenance (air filter, spark plugs, cabin filter replacement; engine oil change; fluid leveling; etc)</li>
                <li>Diagnostic (windshield washer system, motor probe, etc)</li>
                <li>Tire assembly and disassembly</li>
                <li>Brake system maintenance (changes of brake pads, brake disc, brake caliper)</li>
              </ul>
              Apart from the technical part, I also learned a lot about the management of a garage, the time that certain operations could take, the justification of the often high prices of repairs.
            </br>All of this is definitely going to serve me in my personal life if I need to make repairs or maintain my vehicles because I would be able to do it myself and therefore save money.
              But could also be useful to me in my professional life if I ever decide to make a second job out of it.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              I think the hardest part for me in recent years has been having to do my internship in mechanics in addition to my evening classes and my day classes.
              It took a lot of energy, self-sacrifice and hard work, but I'm very proud to have managed to get through it.
            </p>
