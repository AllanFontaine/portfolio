            <h5>Environment/Context</h5> 
              <p>
                At the end of 2018, I found myself in a rather complicated situation. Having already taken advantage of my 3 chances to succeed in my first year of Bachelor, I was refused a re-enrollment at Ephec in order to try my luck again one last time.
                Faced with this situation, I tried my luck with an internal appeal to try to demonstrate my motivation to move forward. However, not being sure that the latter would succeed, I asked a friend of mine to give me information on the courses he was taking, being also passionate about mechanics.
                So I enrolled in EFP in mechanics while hoping to be able to continue at Ephec but if not, I would still have a back-up plan.
              </br>At my surprise, I got a positive answer to my appeal and was then engaged in two studies : during the day I studied computer science and at night mechanics.
                I've decided to continue with my night classes since those were very interesting and I was eager to learn more.
              </p>
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              Actually I've learned so many things in 3 three years that it'll be impossible for me to talk about all of it.
              I'll focus my speech about the topics related in some ways to electronics/IT.
            </br>During my first year at EFP, I had the opportunity to work on test boxes to make simple electrical circuits with relays and lamps in order to learn the basics of electronics. 
              However, having already had a lot of electricity lessons at Ephec and previously at UCL and Ecam, it was not too complicated for me. I understood relatively faster than my classmates and took the time to help them afterwards.
            </br>During my second year, we focused more on on-board computing, the operation of certain electrical parts that make up a car. 
              There I learned to test various components with a multimeter and an oscilloscope, to analyze with the help of the diagnostic device various faults, etc.
            </br>This brings us to this year, mainly consumed by Covid-19, I have not had the opportunity to work a lot directly on the vehicles, except in the second semester thanks to my mechanics internships. 
              However, I had just started my first year of automotive diagnostics, the continuation of my evening classes. 
              I therefore had the opportunity to tackle reading electrical diagrams, detecting more advanced faults, improving our mastery of diagnostic tools (oscillo, picoscope, etc.).
            </br> I have learned a lot over the years at EFP. I'm sure what I've learned will serve me in many ways in the future. 
              Whether it's by having a methodical way of thinking (which automotive diagnostics has given me) or even knowledge in mechanics which could be useful to me in the near future if I have to work on a program for a robot or a machine.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              I'm glad I was able to manage two studies at the same time. 
              This proved to me, after my first three years in university which turned out to be catastrophic, that I was capable of succeeding if I wanted to and that the obstacles are more often in the head than really there.
