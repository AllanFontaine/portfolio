            <h5>Environment/Context</h5> 
            <p>
              I joined Colruyt at the age of 18 in order to have a constant inflow of money throughout the year.
              I was accepted thanks to my brother who had already worked there for some time.
              He warned me that the pay was good and the hours were quite flexible as long as we were working well. 
              It was indeed the case and that's why I'm still working there.
            </br>I work in the warehouses in Dasenvelt and I perform various tasks but mainly orderpicking.
            </p>  
            <h5>What I've learned and how will it serves me</h5>
            <p>
              I had to work with very different schedules and learn to switch between them quite quickly. 
              There are three schedules on the day: 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. and 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
              So I developed a good adaptation to changes in sleep schedule but also a rather good resistance to sleepness.
            </br>I also had the opportunity to develop better management of time and effort. 
              This is mainly due to the fact that we had also our performance monitored. 
              Indeed, if we happened to be too slow, one of the verifiers would call us to order and ask us to speed up or to report to him if there was a problem that made us slower. 
              However if we were faster than expected nothing was offered except that the verifiers would therefore expect us to do at least as well every day.
            </br>The first years were hard because the environment was harsher than what I had encountered so far: I was working for the first time for a very large company with several hundred people.
              But after a few years I got used to it and I was able to diversify myself and do other tasks.
              I've done many things such as fruits and vegetables orderpicking, frozen food orderpicking, unloading and loading of truck trailers, ... 
            </br> I mainly gained a lot in soft skills and management of my ressources (time, effort, ...).
              I think being able to work for that long for a company as a student is a proof of my hard work and my determination to move forward.
              I think that what will be of use to me the most in my future life and that I have learned at colruyt will really be the management of my personal resources.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              Working for a big company taught me a lot of things, including the fact that I would not like to work for a big company later.
